# SensEgg-Light

This is a circuit board layout for a weather sensor. A BME280 is used to measure temperature, humidity and air pressure. In addition, an NTC is used for temperature measurement, the accuracy of which is significantly better than that of the BME280. The recorded data is sent to a receiver by radio (nrf24 module). 

Power is supplied via a 2032 3V button cell. The name comes from the fact that the circuit board fits into a kinder surprise (egg).
